<p><b>SUMMARISED TRANSLATION OF ARTICLES IN EDITION 102/ MAY 2010 OF THE "ONS HAANTJIE" NEWSLETTER OF THE HENNING FAMILY LEAGUE</b></p>
<p>Argentynse Henning Tradisies/ Argeninian Henning Traditions. In the previous newsletter we reported on the monument erected in Comodoro Rivadavia commemorating the Afrikaners who emigrated to Argentinia in 1902 and 1905. Jan (JJP) Henning (b6.c1.d3.e5.f11.g5.) wrote us a letter mentioning that he contacted  Marita van Dijk, the daughter of his cousin, Paul (SJP) Henning. They had a nice talk on all the traditions of their ancestors who lived for some time in Argentina.</p> 
<p>Marita mentioned that she still drink Argentinian Yerba Mate (health tea), which all their ancestors drank for many years. Jan remembered this tea and wrote to the Argentinian Embassy in South Africa, asking where they could getYerba Mate, the calabash used for drinking the tea (mate calabaza) and the pipe and strainer (bombilla).</p> 
<p>Jan and Marita compiled all information on Yerba Mata. They are of the opinion that, not only other descendants of the Argentinian Hennings would be interested in drinking the health tea, Yerba Mate, but that many other Hennings also would be interested.</p>
<p>Anybody interested in the Yerba Mate health tea can contact Jan Henning or Marita van Dijk at the following E Mail addresses: Jan Henning - henning.jan@gmail.com or Marita van Dijk - maritavdijk@gmail.com.</p>
<p>ABO Foto's/ ABW Photo's.The Anglo-Boer War of 1899 - 1902 is generally documented very well. The same applies to the involvement of the Henning family. However, from time time to time we still receive photographs of Henning's who participated. Recently we received two photographs taken in the Diyatalawa POW camp, Ceylon.</p>
<p>No 57 and 58 on the first photo are JL Henning and JJ Henning respectively. We could not identify them positively, due to the fact that only initials are given, but there is a strong possibility that they are b5.c1.d3.e1.f2. Johannes Lodewikus Henning *7-6-1880 and his brother, b5.c1.d3.e1.f1. Joseph Johannes Philippus *20-3-1879. The latter could also be their uncle b5.c1.d3.e6. Joseph Johannes Philippus Henning *25-10-1862. We, however, are of the opinion that it is the former.</p>
<p>The second photograph is of young men of the Rouxville/ Zastron districts. Hennings on this photograph are as follows: Back row, first from the right, b1.c3.d7.e9. Nicolaas Johannes Henning *7-8-1880. Second row, first from the left, presumably b1.c3.d10.e9. Johannes Hendrik (Hennie) Henning *21-1-1882; second from left, b1.c3.d10.e7. Christiaan Rudolf (Chrisjan Houtbeen) Henning *3-8-1877. He was the choirleader on the island; First from the right, JH Henning. Due to the fact that there were so many JH Henning's on the island we could not identify him at all.</p>
<p>'n Amerikaanse Henning Stam/ An American Henning Clan. From time to time we receive enquiries from Henning's in the USA enquiring if we do not have any information on their ancestors. In all the cases they do not have sufficient information for us to help them at all. Recently we received an E Mail from Bruce Henning from High Ridge, Missouri. His uncle (Eugene Henning) compiled many years ago a family tree of their ancestors. According to this family tree their ancestors arrived during the 1730's in Virginia, USA, from Ireland. Eugene thought that Henning was a British surname and only consulted British sources.</p>
<p>Although the document Bruce Henning supplied was taped, some pages was in such a bad condition that it was unreadable. We suggested that Bruce get the whole document deciphered and retyped into a word processing format. There-after we could process it for placement on the Henning website as the family tree of an American Henning clan.</p>
<p>Bruce's reaction can be read in the Afrikaans version of the Newsletter.</p>
<p>Nog Matriek Prestasies/ More Matric Achievemts.b6.c1.d3.e5.f1.g1.h2. Prof Josef Jooste Henning of Hartenbos informed us that his grand daughter, Belindi Henning, daughter of Josef Jooste - and Linda Jacobie Henning of Durbanville also passed matric at the end of 2009. She passed matric with six distinctions at the Durbanville High School. She served on the scholar board of the school. Belindi decided not to go to university this year. She first want to make sure which study direction she want to follow. She is investigating several study direction and has already followed a course how to handle children with autism.</p>
<p>Henning Babas/ Henning Babies. Johanna Henning, widow of the late Pieter Hendrik Henning (b1.c6.d3.e7.f8.g2.) of Doornpoort is a very proud grandmother. Over the past two years she gained two grandchildren. Her daughter, Melanie (h3) and her husband Willie Palmer of Montana, Pretoria,  had a baby girl, Jessica on 11 October 2008 - their second child.</p> 
<p>The first child of Johanna's son Abraham Stephanus (b1.c6.d3.e7.f8.g2.h4.) and his wife, Mari&eacute; was born on 6 July 2009 at Montana, Pretoria - a baby girl with name Megan.</p>
<p>Briewe van ons Lede/ Letters from our Members.b6.c3.d9.e4.f1.g1.h1. Carol Allen (born Henning) *14-8-1954 wrote us a pleasant letter, which can be read in the Afrikaans Nesletter.</p>
<p>b6.c4.d1.e5.f9.g6. Mauritz Martin Henning informed us of a very disturbing case. Sophia Margaretha (Fya) Henning (born Du Plessis), the widow of his late cousin, b6.c4.d1.e5.f4.g3. Evert Philippus Henning *25-10-1914, died 14 January 2010 in the age of 92 years.</p>
<p>She lived in the Koster old age home, fell and broke an arm. She was taken to the local hospital, where she received the worst treatment imaginable. They did not have a X-ray machine and left her to lay without treatment. She was not even washed - and she needed napkins. They refused that a private doctor could be called in. After a visit by Adv. Jan Henning, a family member, the family insisted that she be transferred to Swartruggens, but here things was in no way better. She was sent back to the old age home, for better care. Her arm got very painfull. With the help of her church she was sent to a private hospital in Klerksdorp where they discovered that the bone of the broken arm pushed through the skin, but pulled back. The wound got septic. She was operated because cangreen has already started. She was, by that time so weak that she died the next day. The family is taking the case further. Fya was buried with her husband in Brits.</p>
