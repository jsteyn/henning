<p><b>SUMMARISED TRANSLATION OF ARTICLES IN EDITION 117/FEB 2014 OF THE “ONS HAANTJIE” NEWSLETTER OF THE HENNING FAMILY LEAGUE</b></p>

<p><b>"Bill" Henning van Kenia/Bill Henning of Kenia.</b></p> 

<p>The biological father of Pauline Castle of Wellington, New Zealand was a Henning, but she was adopted as a new-born baby by a New Zealand couple. She, therefore, had no contact at all with her biological parents. As a grown-up she started looking for her biological parents and League Secretary, Olivier Henning assisted her in finding her father and knowledge of his ancestors.</p> 
<p>Her biological father was the late b6.c1.d1.e9.f8. g3. Willem Reimer Henning. Willem’s father Pieter Josef Henning * 3-3-1902 moved as a young man from Aliwal North to Kenia. He married Anna Riemersma and they had three children who were born in Kenia: William * 29-8-1929, Johanna Wilhelmina * 7-4-1932 and Willem Reimer *15-10-1934. Except for a short period in New Zealand, Willem Reimer returned to South Africa, while William stayed lifelong in Kenia. We could reconstruct the family tree of Willem Reimer and his sister Johanna, but could only trace William’s name and date of birth. 
<p>With Pauline’s detective work we could reconstruct the history and family particulars of William Henning. Pauline even made contact with a person who knew William Henning – or Bill - as he was known in Kenia.</p>
<p>Bill Henning drove locomotives as a young man for the East African Railways and Harbours. During 1953 he joined the Kenia Police as a sergeant and was posted as Intelligence Officer at the Mukuruweini Police Station in the South Tetu Devision of the Nyeri Province. It was the days of the huge Mau-Mau riots. Bill Henning was always on the look-out for ulterior or skulldug motives and disappeared for days on end on mysterious missions taking his job very seriously, never averse to a bit of humour.  Younger ignoramuse colleagues reckoned that the lingering aroma of his cigarettes would immediately betray his presence to any lurking Mau Mau but paid much attention to Bill’s mature and nonchalant ruminations on the ways of women. His friend does not think he spoke Kikuyu, though he must have picked up a fair bit, but like most of his colleages he depended on interpreters. Always a tricky business this Kikuyu/Swahili/English transfer as most Europeans didn’t speak proper Ki-Swahili and some translators didn’t speak proper English. There was a lot of tedious cross checking and innumerable minor snafus, some major. (Situation normal, all fouled up.)
<p>Bill Henning was only 36 years old when he died from a heart attack while playing tennis in Nairobi, Kenia. He was married and had two children – a boy and a girl. His wife, Jean, son and daughter, and their families, later emigrated to the United Kingdom. Their particulars has now been included in the Henning Family Cronicle.</p>

<p><b>'n Tragedie in hierdie familie se geskiedenis/A Tradegy in the history of this family.</b></p> 

<p>Marinda Heunis and her husband of Mandini, Natal recently joined the Henning Family League. In the Family Cronicle you will find Marinda in Chapter 6 at b5.c1.d1.e1.f9.g4.h3. Helena Maria Henning *29-11-1950. We had basic particulars of Marinda’s parents and their first four children. Marinda, therefore, could fill us in on the history of this family.</p>
<p>One of the biggest tradegies in the history of all Henning families in South Africa happened with this family on Christmas day 1962. Marinda’s father was the station foreman at the Heuningspruit Station near Kroonstad. He and his wife, Cornelia (known as Mollie) had six children at that stage: Andr&eacute; Johan (15 years), Stephanus Albertus (known as Fanie) (14), Helena Maria (known as Marinda) (12), Margaretha (9), Alfonso (known as Elfie) (3) and Leon (3 months).</p>
<p>On Christmas day 25 December 1962  Izak, his wife Mollie and their youngest two boys accompanied another person in his car. Cornelia sat in the front of the car with the driver, with baby Leon on her lap. Izak and Elfie sat at the back. Apparantly the driver had a heart attack and the car came to a stand still right on the railway tracks at the road crossing at the Heuningspruit station. Two trains — the one from Koppies, as well as the express train from Kroonstad arrived simultaneously at the crossing and demolished the car. One of the train drivers later said that he could see the woman sitting in the front of the car waiving for him to stop, but it was not possible.</p>
<p>Apparantly the driver of the car was already dead when the trains hit the car. Cornelia and the two boys died instantaneously, while Izak died four days later. A peace of iron intruded his head from above and extruded at his mouth. Several bones in his body was broken.</p>
<p>The four oldest chidren, who were now orphans, stayed in the beginning with their grand mother Van der Westhuizen (Cornelia’s parents),  in Cape Town. After a while the two boys were admitted to an orphanage in Cape Town, while the two girls stayed on with their grand mother. Later on, Marinda was also placed in a boarding house. Due to the fact that the children were alienated, they lost all contact with each other. Margaretha died  when she was only 21 years old.</p>
<p>Marinda only know that her brother, Andr&eacute; worked as an electrician on the railways. Fanie was a ticket examiner on the railways, but she does not know where they live and if they are still alive. She traced Fanie’s two sons at their mother, who divorced Fanie soon after their birth.</p> 
<p>League Secretary, Olivier Henning in the mean time traced Andr&eacute;’s name on the 2011 Voters role and could supply Marinda with his address.  He also visited Fanie’s former wife in Parow, Cape Town and she could supply him with a photo of Izak Henning and his wife Cornelia (Mollie). This was also passed on to Marinda.</p> 
<p>Marinda and her husband live in Mandini, Natal. They have a son and a daughter. Their son is married and have a young boy.</p>

<p><b>Boere op die Aardsdrempel/The Boers at the end of the World.</b></p> 

<p>Members of our Family League would be well aware of the four Henning families who emigrated to Argentinia in 1905, after the Anglo Boer War. We covered the history of these families quite good in the Family Cronicle and reported several times on them in the Newsletter.</p>
<p>It has come to our attention that a film producing company, “The Good Work Picture Company” is planning a documentary film of this epic event. They have some funding in place already, but need seed money to get the film off the ground (in film-speak, soft money as development financing). The addition of $ 6,000 will enable them to travel to Argentina, shoot for a week, and go through post-production to result in a complete, powerful 5-minute short documentary.</p> 
<p>They will then use this documentary to attract the production funding for the full feature film. At the very least,  contributions will have allowed them to complete the 5-minute documentary, which can then be entered into festivals and released. The film would be released in Afrikaans, Spanish and English.</p>
<p>The web site of the Good Work Picture Company can be viewed at <u>http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-boers-at-the-end-of-the-world-boere-op-die-aardsdrempel</u> . Anyone who would like to contribute can contact Richard Finn Gregory at the following E Mail address: <u>richard@goodworkpictures.com</u></p>
<p>League Secretary, Olivier Henning already donated a CD with the Henning Familie Cronicle to mr Gregory and supplied him with the E Mail address of Angela Elena (Lita) Henning, who still lives in Argentina and is a member of our Family Leauge. He lent mr Gregory a copy of the book “'n Boer in Argentini&euml;’ (A Boer in Argentina) by PH Henning. Hopefully these resources would help to illustrate the role of the Henning families in this epic event.</p>
<p>Contributors to this campaign can gain several types of bonusses, eg a copy of the DVD, invitation to the introduction or can even be mentioned in the production notes of the film.</p>

<p><b>Sarie Marais — Die Liedjie/Sarie Marais — the Song.</b></p> 

<p>There are not many Afrikaners or even South Africans who do not know the song, Sarie Marais. It is part of our culture. Although the real Sarie Marais  had nothing to do with the Henning family, we believe that all Hennings would embrace this song with love and would like to hear the history of this precious jewel.</p>
<p>The story of Sarie Marais – Susara Margaretha (Sarie) Mar&eacute;. She was the first daughter of Jacob Philippus Mar&eacute; and Cornelia Susanna Jacoba Erasmus. She was born on the farm Eendracht, Suikerbosrand, district Heidelberg on 15 April 1869. Her father, Jacob Mar&eacute;, later became a member of the Executive Committee of the Transvaal and a street in Pretoria was named after him. It can be mentioned that b9.c1.d2. Pieter Hendrik Henning *24-9-1848 and his family lived during the same time on a nearby farm, Valsfontein, in the ward Suikerbosrand, distr. Heidelberg. It is almost certain that they would have known each other.</p>
<p>This is the Sarie Marais (actually Mar&eacute;) who lived in the ward of the Mooiriver, also known as Tant Mossie, according to the catalogue entry AP.1998-227 in the SA Library.</p>
<p>Her parents were Voortrekkers and they settled in the vicinity of the Suikerbosrand. The town of Heidelberg did not yet existed. The biggest concentration of Voortrekkers settled in in the ward of Mooiriver, where the town of Potchefstroom was layed out. During these times there were five wards in Transvaal: Mooiriver (Potchefstroom), Magaliesburg (Rustenburg), Marico (Zeerust), Ohrigstad, Zoutpansberg (Pietersburg). Suikerbosrand was in the ward of the Mooiriver.</p>
<p>At the age of 16 years Sarie met Jacobus Petrus Toerien, a reporter of “Di Patriot” of Paarl. He specially visited the Transvaal for an interview with her father. He wrote under the pseudonym “Jepete” as a sub-editor of “Di Patriot”. They got married and had 16 children, of which only eight grew up.</p>
<p>Jacobus Toerien heard the song “Sweet Ellie Rhee” which had it’s origen in the American civil war, at Americans who worked on the mines in the Transvaal. During the period between the First – and Second Anglo-Boer Wars Jepete translated the song and immotalized his wife, Sarie Mar&eacute;. Initially the song did not have all the verses and the same words as we know it today. Mar&eacute; changed to Marais due to a typing error.</p>
<p>By 1899 Sarie Marais was already a hit in Pretoria. During the Anglo-Boer War it was not only a hit under the Boer forces, but also with other soldiers. It later became well-known worldwide due to South African soldiers singing it during the First- and Second World War.</p>
<p>Due to its popularity the British Royal Marines adopted it as their regimental march. They also named their training vessel Sarie Marais. It is also the regimental march of the Signal Corps of Paraguay.</p>
<p>The first South African yacht was named Sarie Marais and thousands of visitors to the Durban harbour boarded the Sarie Marais Pleasure Boat.</p>
<p>The name of the first South African film was, Sarie Marais. The well known women’s magazine Sarie is also named after her. The same apply to several hotels and blocks of flats.</p>
<p>With the first international radio broadcasting between South Africa, Brittain and the USA on the birthday of mrs Isie Smuts, wife of the former Prime Minister, General Smuts, the singer Gracie Fields sang Sarie Marais.</p>
<p>During the Second World War one of the outposts of soldiers in North Africa bear the name “Sarie Marais Calling”. The South African Defence Force is still fond of using this march during parades, while the French Foreign Legion also uses the song.</p>
<p>It is the official song of the Girl Guides in Sri Lanka (Ceylon) who heard the song at the end of the nineteenth century in the Boer POW camps. During the Olimpic Games in the USA during the 1930’s it was wrongfully played as the official national anthem of South Africa. The Germans grew a new pink rose with the name Sarie Marais. Some of these roses were planted in front of the School of Armour in Bloemfontein.</p>
<p>The last years of Sarie. She was a deep religuous woman and self-glorification was totaly in conflict with her humble disposition. She always kept her engagement with the song quite. After the death of Jacobus in 1920 she settled with her daughter in Bloemfontein. She died on 22 December 1939 in the age of 73 years in poverty and was burried in an humble unmarked grave in the Memoriam graveyard, near the Womens-monument in Bloemfontein.</p>

Vanessa is the daughter of Conrad Barend De Lange and his wife Esta Anita (born Luüs). Gerhard is the son of Gerhardus Stefanis Henning and his wife Deïrdr&eacute; Memory (born Schoeman) of Kimberley.</p>
<p>We also learned of the marriage of b5.c1.d5.e6.f3.g1.h4.i2. Johannes Jacobus (Janus) Henning *18-6-1982 and   Heleen Naude on 23-2-2013 at Pretoria-East. Janus is the son of Johannes Jacobus Henning *16-9-1953 and Arietha (born Viljoen), while Heleen is the daughter of David Frederick Naude and his wife Anna Sophia (born Claassens). We report below on the father of Janus who died later  in 2013.</p>
<p>We reported several times on the achievements of the triplets, Herman -, Anelmi – and Elseri Henning. They are the children of b6.c3.d2.f1.g2.h1. Willie and Gerda Henning of the farm Leeufontein, distr. Burgersdorp. The last time was in Newsletter 110 of May 2010, when we reported on the Honnours degrees all three of them obtained, as well as the marriages of the two girls during 2010. It now came to our attention that Herman got married on 14 December 2013 at Ventersdorp to Magdelie Buyskes, daughter of Pieter and Magda Buyskes of Potchefstroom.</p>

<p><b>Sterftes/Deaths.</b></p> 

<p>b5.c1.d5.e6.f3.g1.h4. Johannes Jacobus Henning *16-9-1953, the father of Janus Henning (above) died on 24-11-2013. During the 1980’s Johannes worked as a Shiftboss on the Oryx mine in the Free State. In 1992 he was transferred to the Lonmin mine (Messina Platinum mine) where he worked until 2005, when he was declared medically unfit due to diabetis. Thereafter he farmed part time near Roedtan until his death.</p>
<p>Jacobus Dani&euml;l (Jaco) Henning of Bloemfontein informed us that his mother, Elizabeth Johanna Henning (born Van der Linde) *29-7-1937 died on December 11 2013. She was the wife of b5.c5.d9.e2.f2.g3. Jacobus Dani&euml;l Henning *25-1-1941</p>
<p>It was also reported to us that b5.c1.d5.e6.f3.g1.h5. Pieter Willem Henning *17-8-1958, the younger brother of Johannes Jacobus Henning (above) died on 1 August 2013 in a road accident near Ventersburg in the Free State. Pieter worked his life long as an underground electrician on the mines near Welkom, and later at the Anglo Plats mine near Marikana. He will be remembered as the chap who loved a barbeque. At least five times a week he lit up a barbeque to to grill his meat.</p>

<p><b>2013 Matrikulante/2013 Matriculants.</b></p> 

<p>39 Henning youngsters obtained matric at the end of 2013 in seven of the nine provinces of South Africa. Unfortunately we could not obtain the results of Natal and the Eastern Cape, but we doubt that there would have been more than one or two children passing matric in these provinces. This is four more that the figure for 2012 but far less than the figures for the 1980’s when the number of Henning’s who obtained matric annually were approximetaly 60 per year. During the 1990’s this figure decreased to approximately 45 per year and since then around 40 per year. The figure of 39 consist of 19 boys and 19 girls with the sex of the 39th unknown due to the fact that this scholar attended a private school and only initials are mentioned with their results. Eight scholars did very well by obtaining several distinctions. Four obtained  7 distinctions, two obtained 6 distinctions, one obtained 5 distinctions and one obtaned 4 distinctions. This is the best achievement of all Henning matric classes since we started keeping statistict in the middle 1980’s. The names of these achievers are:</p>
<p>Nicole Clair Fearne Henning (Gauteng) – 7 distinctions<br>
Cheral-Lee Henning (Northern Cape) – 7 distinctions<br>
R S Henning (private schools Gauteng) – 7 distinctions<br>
Kathleen Henning (Gauteng) – 7 distinctions<br>
Marcus John Henning (Western Cape) – 6 distinctions<br>
Andrew Henning (North West Prov) – 6 distinctions<br>
Alice Henning (Gauteng) – 5 distinctions<br>
Charlise Simon Henning (Free State) – 4 distinctions</p>

<br>'n Nederlandse Henning/A Dutch Henning.</b></p> 

<p>Members with Internet connection would know that we not only display the South African Henning Family Cronicle on the Henning Website, but also the family trees of two German Henning families, two Dutch Henning families, an Estonian Henning family and an Australian Henning family.</p> 
<p>Recently we received a letter from Peter Henning of Eindhoven, Netherland. He was pleasantly surprised to see  the Netherland family tree on our website – especially the completeness and accuracy of the family tree*. He is a member of the “Friesland” clan. Their history follow the route from  Northern Germany to South West Netherland. He, however, grew up in the town  Vilsteren, dist Ommen in East Netherland. His great grand father farmed during the 19th century near Kralingen/Rotterdam. Due to the expansion of Rotterdam his farm has been swallowed by the city in the beginning of the 20th century. The grand father of Peter Henning – Petrus Josephus (Piet) Henning (*1886) – there-after started farming near Lemelerveld, East Netherland and Peter’s father – Gerardus Arnoldus (Gerard) was born here in 1917.</p> 
<p>Gerard Henning settled after the Second World War in the town Vilsteren, near Ommen as a wagonbuilder. When tractors came to the foreground he became a contractor. In 1946 he married Gezina Euphemia (Sien) Korenromp from Luttenberg. They had six children who spread over the whole of Netherland and Belgium over time.</p> 
<p>Peter (*1952) is the 5th child. He did his training in the building industry in Zwolle and in 1974 he studied Industrial Design in Eindhoven. His wife, Inez Maria Geertruda (Inez) de Gier (*1950) came from Kerkdriel, Midden. In their design studio, “Henning Design” both of them do design work for the furniture industry.</p> 
<p>Peter is a keen speed skater. He and Inez have two daughters, Noraly (1989) and Zerline (1991). Both study in Amsterdam. Noraly study medicine and Zerline cultural antropology.</p>
<p>In another letter Peter mention that he always had the idea that the name Henning had something to do with a rooster, and that our website confirmed this suspicion. He compliment us on the name for our Newsletter – “Ons Haantjie” and mention that their children went to a creche with the name “Hanevoet”. The name of their  school newspaper was “Hanesmoesjes” and  their local ice-hockey club is “Eindhoven Kemphanen”.</p>
<p>*  The family trees of the two Netherland Henning clans were compiled by Benjamin Henning and Pieter Verbunt of Netherland. Our league secretary only added an Index for easy reference.</p>

<p><b>Johan Henning van Tygerpoort, Pretoria se Perde/The Horses of Johan Henning of Tygerpoort, Pretoria.</b></p> 

<p>We reported in the February 2013 (no 113) newsletter on the beautiful Percheron horses of b9.c1.d2.e4.f6.g1.h1. Johannes Jacobus (Johan) Henning *2-1-1966 of Klipkop, Tygerpoort, Pretoria. Our readers would know that these huge horses was used in the olden days to pull cannons during war. They were also used to plow the vineards in the Boland.</p>
<p>Johan owns the Summerwind Stud. In the September 2013 issue of the Percheron Association Newsletter we read that one of Summerwind’s newest horses caused a sensation at the Agri Mega Week Exhibition at Bredasdorp when the French stallion, Vulkin Chateaguillon was displayed. Everybody wanted to see this gigantic and beautiful horse.</p>
