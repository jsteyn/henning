<p><b>SUMMARISED TRANSLATION OF ARTICLES IN EDITION 92/ NOV 2007 OF THE "ONS HAANTJIE" NEWSLETTER OF THE HENNING FAMILY LEAGUE</b></p>
Philip Burger, Henning Nasaat/ Philip Burger, Henning Descendant. Up until now, no Henning excelled on the highest level as a rugby player. It came to our attention that the mother of Philip Burger, the outstanding wing of the Free State Cheetahs is a Henning. She is b5.c1.d3.e1.f1.g5.h1. Hendrina Johanna (Erna) Hubbard (born Henning). Philip plays Super 14- and Curry Cup rugby for the Free State Cheetahs and is a Springbok sevens rugby player.</p>
<p>Philip matriculated in 1998 at the "Ho&euml;rskool Randburg". He studied B.Com Marketing at the University of the Free State. During this time he played for the Shimlas, the Free State under 21 team and the Free State Cheetahs. Here-after he played professional Curry Cup rugby for the Pumas (Mpumalanga), before the Cheetahs called him back.</p>
<p>Philip is a son from Erna's first marriage and she is very proud of him.</p>

<p>Otto Henning, Eerste Henning Vee-Arts in Suid-Afrika / Otto Henning, First Henning Vet in South Africa.  We were under the impression that b1.c6.d14.e5. Michiel Wilhelm Henning was the first Henning veterinary surgeon in South Africa. He qualified in 1919 and later became  famous as an academic, who received several international awards.  It recently came to our attention that Otto Henning, who is not related to the Henning clans of South Africa, was in fact the first Henning veterinary surgeon in South Africa.</p> 
<p>Otto Henning was born on 21-11-1865 in Germany. He qualified in 1885 as a veterinary surgeon at the University of Stuttgard. In March 1885 he was appointed as Deputy Veterinarian for the Cape of Good Hope, with headquarters in Cape Town. On 1-11-1896 he was sent to the Orange Free State to assist with Rinder Pest, but a few months later during 1897 he returned on his own to serve as State Veterinarian for the Republic of the Orange Free State. He served until 1900. Due to the  war he changed position frequently.<br>
1900 - 1901 he served in the SA Constabulary (British forces)<br>
1901 - 1902 he became the State Vet for the Basutoland government<br>
1902 - 1903 he became the Head Veterinarian of the "Orange River Colony" (Orange Free State after the British take-over)<br>
1904 - 1907 he served in the Repatriation Department</p>
<p>In 1907 he was appointed as the head of the Department of Agriculture of German-West Africa (the Namibia of today) until he was arrested by the South African forces which took over the country in 1915. In 1921 he was re-appointed and served as State veterinarian at Keetmanshoop until 1923. He died on 10-11-1933 at Grootfontein, South-West Africa.</p>
<p>Otto Henning does not fit into the family trees of any of the South African Henning clans, but he served this country in an excellent way. In the 27 years Olivier Henning have been busy with research into the Hennings of South Africa, this was the first time he came into contact with information regarding him. It will take special research in Namibia to determine if Otto Henning and his wife  had any descendants.</p>
