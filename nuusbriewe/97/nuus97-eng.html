<p><b>SUMMARISED TRANSLATION OF ARTICLES IN EDITION 97/FEB 2009 OF THE "ONS HAANTJIE" NEWSLETTER OF THE HENNING FAMILY LEAGUE</b></p>

<p>Henning Vrou vermoor/Henning wife Murdered. On 9 October 2008, armed robbers broke in to Fisherman's Village.  They held up Linda Patterson (owner of the Christian Centre at Fisherman's Village) and her daughter, Suzanne, and bound their hands behind their backs with shoe laces - and then proceeded to ransack the house and load everything of value in to Linda's car.</p>
<p>Tragically new manager b7.c2.d4.e4.f6.g1.h1. Abraham Johannes (Abri) Henning, along with his wife Riana and their 2 little girls, Marcelle (2) and Anika (1) arrived home from cell group at the same time that the robbers were readying to leave.</p>
<p>When Riana realized that there were armed robbers, she did what any Mom would do - and, in order to protect her girls, she jumped back in to the car and reversed down the driveway.  However, in her panic, she reversed in to a tree.  As the robbers ran away on foot, one of them approached the car and shot Riana dead with one bullet.  Her daughters were in the car when this happened.</p>
<p>Fisherman's Village is a place of restoration and healing.  Founded by Linda Patterson, it's very purpose is to be a place where people can come for support, healing and restoration.  Abri and Riana both devoted their lives to this same cause.</p>

<p>Sterftes/Deaths. We mourn the death of the following Henning's.</p>
b9.c1.d2.e9.f4. Jacob (Japie) Henning *26-3-1925 died 9 October 2008 at the age of 83 years and 6 months in the Bayview Hospital, Mosselbay. Three weeks earlier he underwent a heart bypass operation but unfortunately contracted kidney failure.  He and his wife Lydia lived at a retirement village in Uniondale. Japie qualified as medical doctor in 1949 at the University of Pretoria. He retired theoretically in 1991, when he sold his practice in Bloemfontein,  but kept on practicing at George until the age of 80.</p> 

<p>b5.c1.d3.e1.f7.g2. Abraham Johannes (Ampie) Henning *1-5-1930 died 18 October 2008 at the age of 78 years and 5 months from cancer. He served his whole career in the SA Air Force and retired with rank Brigadier as the Officer Commanding, Air Logistics Command. During a holiday in the Kruger National Park during May 2008 he suddenly became ill and advanced cancer was diagnosed. Ampie and his wife, Ina lived in Wierda Park, Centurion.</p>

<p>b7.c2.d15.e2.f5. Amelia Leona Perkins (born Henning) *16-11-1932  died on 27 July 2008 at Springs. She was 75 years and 7 months old. She was married to Frederick  William Perkins, but he already died in 1975 at the age of 47.</p>

<p>b1.c6.d11.e10.f2. Lourens Jacobus (Lou) Henning *14-9-1942 died on 11 December 2008. Right through South Africa he was well known as the famous cartoonist of the Sunday newspaper, RAPPORT. Lou lost his battle against cancer. For more than 30 years his drawing pen amused readers - and let them think, first in the  daily newspapers, Die Transvaler and Die Vaderland  and later RAPPORT. He was reckoned as one of the great masters of his trade. During the early days of the Family League we could not copy photographs for the Newsletter. Lou often made several  sketches for the Newsletter.</p> 

<p>Hy het sy broek Volgestaan/He filled up his Pants quite Well. Those of us who attended Family League AGM's and family festivals during the 1980's and 90's, will remember b7.c2.d4.e6.f1.g3. Johannes Benjamin Henning. He always arrived with his huge motorbike, because he could not fit into any motorcar. Unfortunately Johannes passed away during 2002. Recently we received an amusing newspaper clipping of Johannes from Mauritz Henning of Theresa Park, Pretoria North. The caption of the photo can be translated as follows: "Mr Johannes Henning had reason to smile, when he discovered a shop in Pretoria which provided for huge people. On the left of the photo the staff of the shop, mr Harry Louw, Vincente la Ruffe (owner) and Stanley Anderson can be seen, al of them in the pants of one Henning man.</p>

<p>Lippstadt, Duitsland en die Hennings/Lippstadt, Germany and the Hennings. We are aware of four Henning families who visited Lippstadt, Germany since Olivier Henning started his research into the Henning family in 1980. Lippstadt being the birth place of Peter Henrich (Pieter Hendrik) Henning the  progenitor of most of the Hennings of South Africa (1740). We could ascertain that the Henning family lived in a house on the corner of Woldemei- and Klusetor str. Unfortunately the original houses (all older than 300 years) became so dilapidated that they were demolished in the 1970's and new commercial buildings were erected.</p> 
<p>One block further, on the corner of Woldemei - and Luchten str one find a nice drink water fountain, where you could drink cool water with several bronze farm animals. All four families (without any consultation whatsoever) took photographs at this fountain.  Stanley Henning (and his wife, Mary-Ann), who visited Lippstadt last year, grew up on a farm. He observed that the sculptor of the fountain must have had a good sense of humor. The expression on the face of the horse is typical of a stallion which smells a mare on heat. We wonder how many people (even old Lippstadters) have observed this.</p>

<p>Henning Graduandi/Henning Graduands. Two Hennings obtained degrees at the end of 2008 at the University of Pretoria:</p>
<p>b5.c2.d13.e1.f3.g1.h2.i1. Lenise Henning *1-7-1985, daughter of Ignatius Wilhelm Henning and his wife Catharina Magdalena (born Mans) received the degree B Ing (Industrial Engineering);
b1.c6.d11.e3.f1.g2.h3. Andrew Henning *14-4-1982, son of William Desmond Henning and his wife Linda Mary (born Pearse) received the degree BvSc (Veterinary Science).</p>

<p>Prof Jozef Henning en Orania se Donkies/Prof Jozef Henning and Orania's Donkeys. Orania is the first growthpoint of a future Afrikaner Homeland. Those who have visited the village, will be able to testify that this is a small, urbine, progressive community. We read in the November 2008 issue of the Orania Movement's splendid magazine, "VOORGROND" a priceless article concerning b6.c1.d3.e4.f2.g2.h1. Prof Jozef Jooste Henning. Jozef had been involved with the coming into being of the village since the early 1990's.</p>

<p>Henning Webwerf/Henning Website.  If you have  not visited the Henning website recently, you should do so soon.The photo albums of the different branches became so large that they downloaded very slowly. We reduced the size of all photographs and divided the large albums  in two or three parts, therefore, they download now much quicker.  Please visit www.henning.org</p>
