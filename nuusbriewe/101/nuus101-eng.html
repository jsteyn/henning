<p><b>SUMMARISED TRANSLATION OF ARTICLES IN EDITION 101/ FEB 2010 OF THE "ONS HAANTJIE" NEWSLETTER OF THE HENNING FAMILY LEAGUE</b></p>

<p><b>Boer van die Jaar Toekenning/ Farmer of the Year Award.</b> In November 2009, Agri Letaba representing five farmers unions in Limpopo, elected b7.c8.d8.e5.f3. Pieter Naude Henning *4-11-1957 of Tzaneen distrik as their corporative Farmer of the Year.</p> 
<p>Pieter also has extensive business interests. These include property development, engineering, energy saving, forestry, woodwork and avocado farming.</p>
<p>He is a member of Agri Letaba, Greater Tzaneen Business Chamber, the Avocado Growers Association and Forestry SA. He is Chairman of the Magoebas-kloof and Mathuenyeng landowners association, all of whose farms are subject to land claims.</p>

<p><b>Sterftes/ Deaths.</b> With regret we take note of the following deaths:</p>
<p>b1.c3.d10.e4.f6.g1. Olof Abraham Henning *9-8-1938 on 10 August 2009 at Fraaiuitsig, Kleinbrakrivier.</p> 
<p>Olof, who grew up in Zastron, spent most of his life in the OFS. He gained his PhD in Education and after serving as a Headmaster for a number of years he became joint professor of Applied Education. A busary from the Goethe-Institute enabled him to further his studies in Germany. He retired with his wife Fransie to Klein Brak River.</p>
<p>Olof sourced most of the photos of the Johannes Gerhardus Henning branch. With his death we have lost a highly valued and respected supporter.</p>

<p><b>Some members of the first management committee of the family league. Liza Brummer being the only woman</b></p>
 
<p>b1.c6.d3.e11.f3. Francois De La Rey Henning *8-12-1914 on 12 November 2009 at Fochville. Born on the farm Swartfontein in the Zastron district, his father died when he was 14 and landed up in a orphanage. Nevertheless he dreamt of becoming a writer.</p> 
<p>With a Standard 8 in his pocket, he joined the SA Police, began writing poetry for The  Brandwag. Olaf Andresen, the composer hired him to write lyrics for his new compositions. "Die Poskoets" (Mail Coach), sung by Amanda Hall was often broadcast by the SABC.</p>
Frans, a fiery Afrikaner nationalist and officer in the Ossewa Brandwag, was briefly interned during WWII at Koffiefontein where he befriended advocate B.J. Vorster, the future President of SA. Frans was never charged.</p>
<p>He worked as a proof reader for Dagbreek en Sondagnuus and some publishers. In 1959 he returned to Zastron to farm only to return to city life in 1962 and later got divorced. In 1970 he married Maria Elizabeth Buys.</p>
<p>Neels, his eldest son, resides in the USA and said, "When you lose a parent, you ask yourself, 'What did I learn from him/her'? My father dreamt, but there is nothing wrong with dreaming big. I achieved more dreams than he - but only because I stood on his shoulders and could see further ahead than he".</p> 

<p>b7.c8.d5.e10.f6. Elizabeth (Liza) Brummer (born Henning) *Maclear 6-7-1948 on 18 November 2009 from cancer at Moreletta Park, Pretoria.</p>
<p>Liza was not only a founder member of the Family League (21 July 1984) but also served on the the League's inaugural management committee. Le Roux Brummer, her husband, succeeded her three years later. She was a valued and reliable supporter.</p>

<p>Albertina Magdalena Henning (born van der Smit) *25-8-1920, wife of the late b1.c3.d10.e10.f4. Henning Willem Jacobus Henning on 12 Desember 2009 at the age of 89 years and four months at Sederberg Retirement Village, Pretoria.</p>  
<p>Aunt Alie was a descendant of the Dorslandtrekkers (Thirst Land Trekkers) who trekked to Angola in the 1870s. She was born in Mombola, Angola. Most of these trekkers returned to SWA (Namibia) in1928 where she met and married her future husband Henning Henning on 1 December 1942 at Outjo, Namibia.</p>

<p><b>Briewe van Buitelandse Hennings/ Letters from Foreign-based Hennings.</b> People worldwide, visit our website in an attempt to find their roots. Unfortunately we could not help Ariel Henning from Lima, Peru other than to suggest he goes through the two German Ancestry Registers on our website. His father was Karl Hennings. (Read his letter in die Afrikaans Newsletter).</p>

<p><b>2009 Matrikulante/ 2009 Matriculants.</b> When the original research was done for the Henning Family Tree (1980-1985) and the first book issued, not a single 2009 matriculant or degree recipient, had been born. Indeed many of their parents were then youngsters and not on our database. Finding accurate address lists these days is impossible with the result that only 14 of the 42 Henning matriculants could be traced. Such a shame because we are proud of them.
Unfortunately we could not obtain results for East Cape, Natal, North-West and Mpumalanga. These provinces normally have a few matriculants. As usual Gauteng provided the most maticulants. Of interest is the fact that in the mid '80s some 60 Hennings matriculated; for 2009 the figure is 42.</p>
<p>Our "topgun" for 2009 was b6.c3.d3.e4.f1.g1.h2.i2.j1.Anja Nanine Henning of  Oos-Moot High School, Pretoria (eight distinctions) - daughter of Johannes Christiaan (Jan) Henning and his wife Rachel Cecilia (born Goosen). In 2009 Anja was made a Presidential Scout in the Voortrekker Movement - the highest possible rank for a schoolboy/girl. She has enrolled as a medical student at the University of Pretoria.</p> 
<p>The names can be seen in die Afrikaans Newsletter.</p>

<b><p>b6.c3.d3.e4.f1.g1.h2.i2.j1. Anja Nanine Henning *22-10-1991, daughter of Jan and Rachel Henning of Silverton, Pretoria, achieved most distinctions.</b></p>

<p><b>Reyco Henning en die Groot Hadronbotser/ Reyco Henning and the Great Neutron Accelerator.</b>  Twenty one First World countries participate in the European Community's Neutron Reseach facility which is 6.9kms long, 100 metres underground and on the border between Switzerland and France. Scientists are trying to establish the basic building blocks of everything in the Universe, how it all fits together ie the Laws of Nature. 3000 of the worlds best scientists are working on the project.</p>

<p>b1.c6.d3.e11.f3.g1.h1. Reyco Henning, a product of Water Kloof High (1993) came in the top 1% worldwide in the American University Entrance Examinations. This won him a busary. He completed his BSc with Maths and physics (Magna Cum Laude); then his PhD at the prestigeous Massachusets Institute for Technology where he researched  sub-atomic particles (neutrons) - exactly what the Neutron Accelerator facility is experimenting with.</p>  
<p>Reyco is Assistant Professor of Particle Physics at the University of North Carolina. For his comments on the Neutron Accelerator facility refer to  http://moreheadplanetarium.org/blog/?tag=reyco-henning</p>  

<p><b>Monument ter Ere van die Boere in Argentini&euml;/ Monument in Honour of the Afrikaners in Argentinia.</b> We have previously mentioned the four Henning families that emigrated to Argentinia in 1905 - an earlier group of Boers settled there in 1902.</p> 
<p>Under the guidance of b6.c1.d3.e5.f3. Pieter Hendrik Henning most Hennings returned to South Africa in 1938, but b6.c4.d7.e1. Willem Frederik Henning *17-3-1874 remained in Argentinia as did some single Henning women who later married non-Hennings. Unfortunately, contact with the descendants of Willem Frederik Henning was lost (see photo in the Family Chronicle).</p> 
<p>In 2002 a monument was erected at Comodoro Rivadavia in honour of these settlers and consists of granite maps of South Africa, of the Argentine Province of Chubut, a granite ox wagon and a Rememberance Plaque on which the surnames of all the Boers who settled in Argentinia, is recorded. The square where the monument was erected was renamed "Boulevard Colectividao Sudafricana" as was a street in Comodoro Rivadavia to "Colonos Sudafricanos". Translated it reads: "South-African Colony". A number of street residents are descendants of the Afrikaner immigrants.</p>
<p>Word has it that the "Boere Community" still adhere to their traditions - farm with sheep, prepare "boerekos", sing songs such as Sarie Marais", "Tannie met die rooi rokkie" en "Suikerbossie".  Many older than 45 still speak Afrikaans fluently. During the Falklands War (1982) they fought against the English, but this time as Argentinians.</p>

<p><b>The "Boulevard Colectividad Sudafricana" squire in Comodoro Rivadavia</p>

<p><b>The memorial plague with the surnames of all the Boers who emigrated to Argentinia in 1902 en 1905. The surname Henning can be seen clearly among the surnames. The  Henning family played a prominent role in the community's life but also in the return in 1938 of a large contingent of Boers to South Africa.</p></b> 

<p><b>The Afrikaans and Spanish inscribed cornerstone of the Gereformeerde Church, Comodoro Rivadavia erected in 1934. Prior to erection the Boers held their church services on the farm  Morgenzon, belonging to b6.c1.d3.e5. Joseph Jooste Henning.</p></b>

<p><b>The building of the Association of Christian Women of the South African community.</p></b>

<p><b>The street  in Comodoro Rivadavia that was renamed "Colonos Sudafricanos" - the Spanish for "South- African Settlers. Various old South African families still live in this street with the result that the munisipality recently approved to rename the street.</p></b>
