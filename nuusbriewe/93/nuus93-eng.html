Gideon Henning (72) is Chairman of the Family League, but he is also a provincial badminton player, representing Boland at National Masters League tournaments.

<p>Gertrude Steenkamp (gebore Henning) / Gertrude Steenkamp (born Henning). In the previous newsletter (no 92/Nov 07) we reported on the death of b5.c4.d7.e1.f1. Gertruida Susanna Steenkamp (born Henning) on 11 September 2007 in the age of 101 years.</p>
<p>Our League Secretary receives from time to time letters which he calls "unresolved cases". From time to time he works through this file to see if there is any progress. During October 2004 he received a letter from a "Gertrude", without address or surname - see letter. It now became clear that this letter was from the (at that stage) 98 years old Gertrude Steenkamp.  
<p>If we just knew, we would have arranged for a visit to Gertrude ... but unfortunately it is too late now.</p>

<p>Rowers skiet Henning boer / Gang of Robbers shoot Henning farmer. Early morning 17 November 2007 a gang of five heavily armed robbers attacked the homes of the labourers on the farm of b7.c7.d10.e3.f1. Philippus Arnoldus (Flip) Henning in the Trompsburg district. They tried to force the labourers to give them information and the keys of the Henning farmhouse. They killed one of the labourers, because he refused to participate and terrorised the other families. They forced one of the women, who worked in the farmhouse, to accompany them, to get access.
<p>In the meantime Flip Henning suspected that something was wrong with the labourers, because they did not turn up at 07h00 for their usual morning prayers at the farmhouse. He went to look for them. On his way Flip met the robbers and they started shooting at him, wounding him seriously. Fortunately Flip still had the power to warn his wife by Cellphone. She immediately warned other farmers in the neighbourhood and within minutes all the escape routes were blocked. The five robbers were arrested, by the time the police arrived. One of the robbers there-after committed suicide.The same morning Flip was operated in the MediClinic Hospital in Bloemfontein and he is busy recovering.</p>  

<p>Gewapende Rooftog by Henning Woning / Armed Raid on Henning Home. During November 2007 b7.c2.d3.e5.f2.g3. Pieter Emile Henning and his wife, Pat from Malanshof, Randburg were watching a World Cup rugby match on TV at their home. Armed robbers entered the house, skooting one of the two watchdogs and lashed down Pieter and Pat. When Pieter started talking to the robbers, they shot a bullet near his feet to scare him. It was clear that the smallest mishap would encourage them to kill Pieter.</p>
<p>Pat pleaded with the robbers and told them that her husband was deaf and could not hear their instructions properly. They looted almost everything they could fit into Pat's car and drove of.
<p>The car was later found in a nearby squatter camp. Unfortunately nothing in the house was insured, but they are grateful that nobody was hurt.</p>
