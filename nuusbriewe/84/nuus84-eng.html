<p>2. b6.c3.d2. Willem Frederik Henning *4-7-1830 en sy Kleinseuns wat na hom vernoem is / b6.c3.d2. Willem Frederik Henning *4-7-1830 and his grandsons named after him.</p>
<p>Mrs Rina Venter of Garsfontein, Pretoria received the photo in the article from Petro Steenkamp, the widow of Rev. Willem Steenkamp. It is a photo of b6.c3.d2. Willem Frederik Henning *4-7-1830 and his five grandsons named after him.</p>

<p>We could identify only two of the boys, namely Willem Frederik Steenkamp, born C 1890, S/o b6.c3.d2.e2. Anna Maria Henning and her husband Louis Stephanus Steenkamp (right front of the photo), the father of Rev Willem Steenkamp. To his left is b6.c3.d2.e8.f1. Willem Frederik Henning *8-3-1911, S/o Willem Frederik Henning and Hendrina Johanna Henning (b6.c1.d3.e4.f3.). We know that b6.c3.d2.e6.f1. Willem Frederik Henning *23-10-1893 S/o Hermanus Marthinus Henning and Anna Johanna Vorster is also on the photo, but cannot identify him positively.</p>

<p>3.	b5.c4.d7. Pieter Hendrik Henning se Geboortedatum/The Date of Birth of b5.c4.d7. Pieter Hendrik Henning</p>
<p>b5.c4. Jacobus Cornelis Stephanus Henning *16-8-1811 and his wife  Hester Margaretha van der Linde lived most of their lives on the farms Geelbeksfontein and Jakkalsfontein in the Colesberg (later Noupoort) district. They had nine children. All these children, except their seventh child, Pieter Hendrik, were baptised in the church at Colesberg. We could not find out where Pieter Hendrik was baptised, with the implication that we could not determine his exact date of birth.</p>
<p>b5.c4.d7.e1.f3.g1.h1. Stephen Henning of Northmead, Benoni informed us that he recently inherited a pocket watch from his late father, James Cornelius. James inherited the watch from his grandfather, Jacobus Cornelis Stephanus Henning *19-7-1872.
<p>On the backplate of the watch is engraved Pieter Hendrik Henning 26/2/1848 (the father of Jacobus C S). This indicate byond doubt that the watch originally belonged to b5.c4.d7. Pieter Hendrik Henning and that his date of birth must have been 26-2-1848. This date fits perfectly between the dates of birth of his sister just older than him (Alida, *25-8-1846) and his sister just younger than him (Cornelia *1849)</p>

<p>4. Goue Bruilof vir Eric en Ellen/Golden Wedding for Eric and Ellen Eric Michael Naude and his wife b7.c2.d4.e6.f1.g1. Ellen Elizabeth Henning of Rosslynn, just outside Pretoria are for many years active members of the Family League.</p>
<p>During the first week of September 2005 they commemorated their 50th wedding aniversary. Their twin daughters, Ren&eacute; and Desere&eacute;, arranged a lovely reception. Ren&eacute;’s husband, Johan Vermaak, the Minister of the local NG Church congregation, was the master of ceremonies.</p>

<p>5. Voorsitter van Familiebond Verjaar/Birthday of the Chairman of the Family League
<p>b7.c8.d8.e1.f5. Gideon Stephanus (Giep) Henning of the Strand, who has been Chairman of the Family League for the past 7 years, commemorated his 70th birthday on 10 October 2005.</p> <p>Congratulations!</p>	
<p>6. Geldsake/Money Matters</p> 
<p>We report on donations made over the past three months by members</p>
<p>Lizelle Henning (a young girl who just started working) – R500.00</p>
<p>Stephen Henning – R500.00</p>
<p>Sylvia Grobler (born Henning) and husband Gert – R300.00</p>
<p>In the previous Newsletter we reported that we intended closing our cheque account and only work with a savings account. This proved to be the wrong decision and will no longer close the cheque account. Members are invited to deposit all donations into the cheque account with name Henning Familiebond at ABSA Bank Villiersdorp, Branch no 334-612. Account no 2890 610 423.</p>
<p>At the end of 2005 there were still 12 members who have not made their donations for the year 2005 to the Family League.
<p>We invite members to give consideration to the idea of using a monthly Debit Order for making donations to the Family League. In stead of one big donation, a monhly Debit Order with a small amount of as little as R20.00 is of great value to the Family League.</p>

<p>7. Name met ‘n Bybelse Oorsprong/Names with its origins in the Bible. Article in English</p>

<p>8. Sterftes/Deaths</p>
<p>We report on the death of one of our Honorary Members, b6.c4.d1.e5.f3.g7. Willem Frederik Henning *17-9-1922 of De Wagendrif, Cullinan on 6 October 2005. He died of a heart attack and was burried at Cullinan on 11 October.</p>

<p>We report on e-mail letters received from Hennings from other countries. All letters is in <p>English. We will only translate the remarks made at each letter.</p>
<p>Remarks on Udo Henning’s letter: It appears as if this family fit into the clan of the Demmin Hennings. Further investigation would be necessary.</p>
<p>Remarks on Heino Henning’s letter: It appears as if this family fit into the Henning clan which originated in Riga, Silesia — today part of Latvia. Their farm in Estonia is 7 kilometres from the Latvia border.</p>
<p>Remarks on Chester’s letter from the USA: We have no information to assist Chester</p> 
         
<p>11.	De Vrouwe Petronella</p>
<p>It is known that the Henning progenitor, Pieter Hendrik Henning *1-12-1740, emigrated during 1765 to the Cape of Good Hope and that he traveled with the ship De Vrouwe Petronella. We found interesting information on the Vrouwe Petronella on the web-site of the Dutch Marine Museum.</p>
<p>The Vrouwe Petronella was a return ship built for the Chamber of Enkhuizen, in the ship yard of Enkhuizen. Its loading capacity was 880 tons. The ship was in use at the VOC (United East India Co) from 1755 until 11-1-1768, when it sank in the mouth of the Ganges river in India.</p>
<p>The ship was mostly used on cruises between Texel, Netherlands and Batavia. It departed on 1 December 1765 on its fourth cruise from Texel to Batavia. The captain during this cruise was Steven Booms. The ship arrived on 15 March 1766 at the Cape of Good Hope and departed on 3 April 176 on the rest of its journey. It arrived on 21 June 1766 at Batavia.</p>
<p>All indications exist that Pieter Hendrik Henning travelled on this journey. We found a photo of scale model of the ship on the website.</p>
