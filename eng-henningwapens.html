<p>Nobles and knights started using Coat-of-Arms during the Middle Ages.  To identify himself during battle and military tournaments, a knight painted something on his shield. This became his personal identification. He also used this picture as his personal seal &mdash; almost like ones signature in modern times. A signature is only one persons identification and nobody else.
</p><p>
In time the oldest son started using his fathers shield (and the Coat-of-Arms on the shield). Even later this Coat-of-Arms were used as family Coat-of-Arms.
</p><p>
At present we are only aware of three Henning families &mdash; one in South Africa and two in Germany using specific Coats-of-Arms. Over the ages several Henning / Hennings / Hennig Coats-of-Arms were used. In the authoritative publication "Armrial Géeacute;néeacute;ral" by J B Rietstap, which have been illustrated by Roland, more than 112 000 family Coats-of-Arms are shown. Of these eleven (11) were identified as Henning / Hennings / Hennig Coats-of Arms. These Coats-of-Arms are also shown below.
