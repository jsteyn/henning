<h1>HENNING COATS-OF-ARMS</h1>

<p style='text-align:justify'>Nobles and
knights started using Coat-of-Arms during the Middle Ages.  To identify himself
during battle and military tournaments, a knight painted something on his
shield. This became his personal identification. He also used this picture as
his personal seal — almost like ones signature in modern times. A signature is
only one persons identification and nobody else.</span></p>



<p style='text-align:justify'>In time the
oldest son started using his fathers shield (and the Coat-of-Arms on the
shield). Even later this Coat-of-Arms were used as family Coats-of-Arms.</span></p>



<p style='text-align:justify'>Family Coats of
Arms originated in the second half of the twelfth Century in Europe. Mankind’s
desire to portray his personality by means of a symbol, is, however, as old as
mankind itself.</span></p>



<p style='text-align:justify'>At present we
are only aware of three Henning clans — one in South Africa and two in Germany using specific Coats-of-Arms. Over the ages several Henning / Hennings / Hennig
Coats-of-Arms were used. In the authoritative publication “<i>Armorial Général</i>”
by J B Rietstap, which have been illustrated by Roland, more than 112 000
family Coats-of-Arms are shown. Of these eleven (11) were identified as Henning
/ Hennings / Hennig Coats-of Arms. These Coats-of-Arms are shown below</span></p>



<p style='text-align:justify'>Shortly after
the Second World War a certain N H Theunissen published a series of articles in
<i>Brandwag</i>, a magazine of that time, in which he described several family
Coats-of-Arms used by Afrikaans families. It was not long before the
unsuspecting South African population started accepting these coats-of-arms as
authentic. Souvenirs like ashtrays, wall plates, plaques were produced and our
people snatched them up. </span></p>



<p style='text-align:justify'>As part of his
research the author wanted to ascertain whether South African Hennings were
entitled to use any specific coat-of-arms. He studied several authoritative
publications on heraldry and had intensive discussions with influential people
in heraldry, like the South African State Herald (mr Fred Braunell) and Dr C
Pama a world renown genealogist and heraldist.</span></p>



<p style='text-align:justify'>It soon became
clear that only a small group of Henning and Hennig descendants of Georg
Friedrich Henning, who arrived during 1765 from Silesia (today Poland) at the
Cape of Good Hope, could <u>possibly</u>  claim the use of the coat-of-arms on
offer. Georg Friedrich Henning and his descendants are discussed in Chapter 11
of the Family Cronicle.</span></p>



<p style='text-align:justify'>This
coat-of-arms belonged to a Henning family living during the middle-ages in Silesia. Georg Friedrich came from Silesia. Although there is no substantial proof that
Georg Friedrich belonged to this family, this is a possibility, therefore, we
do not have any objections against descendants of Georg Friedrich Henning using
this coat-of-arms.</span></p>



<p style='text-align:justify'>It seems as if
Theunissen simply took Rietstap’s book, chose the Silesian Henning
coat-of-arms, due to the fact that Georg Friedrich Henning came from Silesia
and presented it as the coat-of-arms of  all the Hennings in South Africa — not
knowing that Georg Friedrich Henning was only the progenitor of a small group
of less than 200 Henning and Hennig’s in South Africa, out of a total of
approximately 4 000 Hennings. </span></p>



<p style='text-align:justify'>Absolutely no
connection between any of the other coats-of-arms and any of the other clans
could be found. The descendants of Peter Henrich Henning (more than 90% of all
Hennings in South Africa) developed into a new clan, with its own traditions
and habits, in a new country with a new nation — the Afrikaners, with a new
language — Afrikaans. Over more than 200 years the Hennings participated in
this development</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><b>ESTABLISHMENT
OF A FAMILY LEAGUE AND REGISTRATION OF A LEAGUE COAT-OF-ARMS</span></b></p>



<p style='text-align:justify'>On 21 July 1984
a group of approximately 30 Hennings gathered at the home of Brig Olivier
Henning at Wierda Park, Verwoerdburg and established a family league.</span></p>



<p style='text-align:justify'>The management
committee elected immediately started with the design of a Coat-of-Arms for the
Family League and the registration thereof at the State Herald. Government
Notice no 575 in Government Gazette 9620 of 15 March 1985  announce the
registration of the Coat-of-Arms and describe it as follows: <i>Arms —Per pale
Gules and Azure, at fes point a wagonwheel surmounted by a cross of
sword-blades Argent, in dexter chief an Afrikander bull passant,in dexter base
a castle and sinister, surmounting the arms of the cross, a lion rampant, Or;a
chief Argent.</i></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><i>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>The symbolism of
the Coat-of-Arms is described as follows:</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:54.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-36.0pt'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The castle, taken from the Coat-of-Arms of the
city, Lippstadt, Germany, symbolizes the origin of PETER HENRICH HENNING,</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:54.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-36.0pt'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The front wheel of an oxwagon symbolizes the
fact that the first three generations Hennings in South Africa were Trek
farmers during the last few years of the 18 th Century and the first three
decades of the 19 th Century, and settled in this untouched and unknown
country,</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:54.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-36.0pt'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The Afrikander ox symbolizes the fact that all
Hennings, up to the beginning of the 20 th Century,were cattle farmers. Today,
we still find a large percentage of farmers under the Hennings. Our love for
nature, our territory and our country is portrayed by this,</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:54.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-36.0pt'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The rampant lion symbolizes bravery and
audacity. The Hennings were pioneers, who bought freedom expensive with
sacrifises of sweat and blood, who made this country habitable. It also
symbolizes that we enter the future with confidence,</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:54.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-36.0pt'>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The cross of sword blades symbolizes the fact
that the Hennings made their contributions during all wars, where the freedom
of our nation was endangered. It also symbolizes the Christianity of the
family.</span></p>



<p style='text-align:justify'>The chief Argent
indicates that it is the Coat-of-Arms of a Family League.</span></p>



<p style='text-align:justify'>Members of the
Family League are entitled to design their own coat-of arms based on the
Coat-of-Arms of the Family League, with their own symbolism placed in the chief
Argent.</span></p>
