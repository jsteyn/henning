<p class=MsoNormal><b>ORIGIN AND MEANING OF THE NAME HENNING</b></p>

<p><span>The name Henning is
indigenous to the North German areas Mecklenburg, Hannover, Hamberg, Holstein and Pommern. Especially the towns Stralsund and Greiffswald, in Mecklenburg, near
the Baltic Sea is well known as places where the name originated. Both towns
formed part of Denmark up until the Thirty Years War (1618 — 1648).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span>Between
the years 1300 and 1500 the name HENNING was used as a popular nickname for “<i>the
Son of John (Johannes)</i>”<i>. </i>In the old Baltic dialect a rooster was
called a “<b><i>Hen”</i></b> (hen = male, henne = female). The Baltic (or North
German) <i>“ing” </i>was added to indicate that it was a name deduced from the
name of a father or ancestor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span>The
name originated amongst noblemen and knights, such as<a href="#_edn1"

<p2>The name Henning originated approximately in the year
1290 near the town STRALSUND, in the North of Germany. In the year 1305 the
name was found in KOLBERG (in the present Poland) and in 1326 in GREIFFSWALD.
LIPPSTADT is the town where Peter Henrich Henning, the first ancestor of the
most Hennings in South Africa, was born</p>

<p><span>During the 13/14<sup>th</sup>
centuries the descendants of these first Hennings spread over the areas today known
as Germany, Denmark, Poland, Latvia, Estonia and Norway. All records from this
time unfortunately were destroyed.</span></p>

<p><span>During the 17<sup>th</sup>
and 18<sup>th</sup> Centuries several Hennings moved elsewhere — also to the
new world. Today we find one of the biggest Henning clans in South Africa. However, we find Henning families in almost every civilised country in the
Western world.</span></p>

<p><img width=628 height=212 src="../images/oorsprong/image002.gif"><span>A few Henning descendants, however,
remained in the vicinity of Stralsund and Greiffswald. It is known that Jacob
Henning (the old) was born during 1635 at Demmin (near Stralsund and Greiffswald).
Jacob Henning and his descendants became  known as the <b><i>Henning Family of
Karnin</i></b>. Karnin is approximately 25 km from Stralsund. Jacob Henning and
his descendants were big and wealthy property owners, who lived in a castle.
This castle was confiscated during 1945, during the Second World War, by the
communist government who took over Eastern Germany. Consequently this family
spread over Western Germany.</span></p>
