<H2>HOW DO I WORK THROUGH THE INFORMATION</H2>
<p><b>To obtain maximum value from this CD, it is essential that you first read and understand this introduction before browsing the CD.</b></p>
<p><b>The Henning Family Chronicle is divided into sixteen sections, as shown on the left side of the screen.</b></p>

<p>The genealogies were constructed according to the method by which the letter a. plus a numerical number (in the order in which they arrived in South Africa) is assigned to the Hennings who emigrated to South Africa and are thus called the progenitors. To the children of these ancestors, therefore the second generation, the letter b. as well as a numeric number starting with 1 for the oldest child, 2 for the second child, 3 for the third child, and so on, is allocated. To the third generation, the letter c. is allocated plus a numeric number indicating the position of the particular child. So will the third child of b1. (ie the first child of the first progenitor) be shown as a1.b1.c3. The third child of b5. (i.e. the fifth child of this progenitor) will again be shown as a1.b5.c3. The same process is repeated with the fourth, fifth and subsequent generations. Only the descendants of the men, that is, those who carry the surname &quot;Henning&quot; are indicated. Where a maid Henning married a young man Henning, their descendants are indicated only in the man&#39;s record. According to this system, each male person&#39;s descendants are fully indicated before proceeding with his or her next sibling&#39;s record.</p>
<p>So if you want to find your ancestors, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to the <a class="rooiraam" href="../databasis/database.htm">Database</a>, on the left of the screen. Enter your own information in the database. This will lead you to your own record. Note what your genealogical number is. If your own name is not included, look for your father or grandfather&#39;s name.</li>
<li>Follow the database instructions to get to each of your ancestors. All information regarding each person is available in the database. Note, however, that you only get a picture of your own direct ancestors and not of other family members, such as cousins, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. You also cannot access the general history of the family through the database.</li>
</ol>

<p>To get a complete picture of the whole family, it is necessary to work through the various genealogy sections - 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. To determine which chapter your family&#39;s details appear in, follow these steps:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="../afrikaans/afdeling5.htm">Section 5</a> deals with the descendants of Christoffel Henning (a1). If your genealogical number begins with a1, your details will appear in this chapter;</p>
<p><a href="../afrikaans/afdeling6.htm">Section 6</a> deals with the descendants of Peter Henrich Henning (a2). If your genealogical number starts with a2, your details will appear in this chapter;</p>
<p><a href="../afrikaans/afdeling7.htm">Section 7</a> deals with the descendants of Georg Friedrich Henning (a3). If your genealogical number starts with a3, your details will appear in this chapter;</p>
<p><a href="../afrikaans/afdeling8.htm">Section 8</a> deals with the descendants of Johan Wilhelm Henning (a4). If your genealogical number starts with a4, your details will appear in this chapter;</p>
<p><a href="../afrikaans/afdeling9.htm">Section 9</a> deals with the descendants of Carl Christian Hennings (a5). If your genealogical number starts with a5, your details will appear in this chapter;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In these sections you can use one of two methods to reach your own record:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the first method, you start at the progenitor and look from him further to yourself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.1 Obtain your genealogical number in the database. Women can look up their spouse&#39;s genealogical number in the
database. If your own name is not included in the database, look for your father or grandfather&#39;s name in the database.</p>
<p>1.2 Record your (or your father&#39;s / grandfather&#39;s) genealogical number. For example: your number is indicated as
a2.b1.c3.d8.e3.f1.g5.</p>
<p>1.3 Using the above example, go to the record of a2.b1. in section 6, that is, the eldest son of the progenitor Peter
Henrich Henning.</p>
<p>1.4 The next step is to go to a2.b1.c3. record (ie b1&#39;s third child), then a2.b1.c3.d8. (ie c3. 8th child).</p>
<p>1.5 This process is repeated for a2.b1.c3.d8.e3. and a2.b1.c3.d8.e3.f1.</p>
<p>1.6 If you look at a2.b1.c3.d8.e3.f1.g5. you will notice that it is your own (or your father&#39;s / grandfather&#39;s) record.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2. According to the second method, look for yourself back to the progenitor. You use the same technique as the first method. However, you just omit the last generation&#39;s code every time.</p>
